The standard way to serve fugu is as thin slices of sashimi arranged in a foral pattern with a side of ginger and wasabi. You can also bake dried fugu fins and serve them in hot sake as a dish called <i>hire-zake.</i> The most common place to find fugu in Osaka is at a restaurant called <i>Zuboraya.</i></p>
