        <p class="text1">Shintennoji temple was one of the first Buddhist temples built in Japan, and it still stands to this day. Located near Shintennojimae-yuhigaoka Station and Tennoji Station, it is very accessible to travelers. If you have an interest in Japanese history, architecture, or Buddhist culture, this is a must-see! Believed to be built about 1,400 years ago, this temple is rich in history. Originally constructed in 593 AD, the temple was created to teach and spread Buddhism at a time when it wasn't particularly popular. In 1946 Shintennoji was home to an independent sect of Buddhists, whose goal was to revolutionize the very concept of "sects" in and of itself; they wanted to allow any and everyone to join. Additionally, there are several different buildings, gardens, and pagodas on the temple grounds that you can visit.</p>

        <img class="shadow" src="../IMG/osaka%20sumo.jpg" alt="Sumo Spring" width="400" height="350"></a>
        <p class="text2">Sumo wrestling is the national sport of Japan. A style of wrestling dating back to ancient times, the sport was originally seen as a performance to entertain Shinto gods (also known as <i>kami),</i> which are sacred spirits believed to take the form of different elements, such as wind, rain, trees, rivers, etc. Many rituals with religious backgrounds, such as "purifying" the ring with salt, are still followed to this day. The rules of sumo are as follows: The first wrestler to exit the ring or touch the ground with any body part other than the soles of their feet loses. Matches take place on an elevated ring called the <i>dohyo,</i> which is made of clay and covered in a layer of sand. A round usually lasts just a few seconds and rarely goes over a minute or two. There are no weight restrictions or classes in sumo, allowing for easily mismatched line-ups; however, if one's technique and skill is great enough, they can still be victorious!</p>
        <div class="textli">
            <ul>
                <li>Prices range from ¥4,600 ($43.38)-12,300 ($116.01) including the service charge depending on the day, and seating for a tournament. Tickets can purchased through the offical vendor or via buysumotickets.com</li>
